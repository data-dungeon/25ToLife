Current Milestones
============================================================================
Edge Collapse

SplitEdge
   Vertex locations look wrong.  Is it tangents?
   Connect doesn't work so well, also continuity?
   Doesn't work correctly in Mirror mode
   Do we want it to enter vertex mode?
   Is position correct or does it seem to flat
   Get Rid of all the menu items
   
Split Ring tool
   Find Continuity Problem for loops
   
Make SplitPoly not realtime and hook up SplitRing   

============================================================================
BUGS
============================================================================
Continuity bad in SplitPoly
SplitEdge crash in mirror mode, test one away from axis too
Mirror mode center points
Connect across axis
Connect doesn't support continuity
Weld in mirror mode
------------------------------
Speed up mirror mode by using maps
FlipNormal Working
Can't have face near focus anymore because it picks edges
Changing seletion types shouldn't reset manipulator if possible. Tough
real-time mouse over
Why CreateSurface have Undo commented out for added to an existing
Any manipulator other than Single pick you can't translate
2 separators when delete menu is called
OnSetCursor should use view it is over's manipulator not current manipulator
Load Selection Toggle
Undo needs to cancel current manipukator
Right click should replace selection if the clicked object is not selected.
Right click should Set Focus if the clicked object is not selected.
fix having a PopupEdit open and closing or deleting a model that the popup is a property of
Delete PolySets needs to somehow Disconnect the PropertyPlys;
Delete TexCoordSet undo needs to dirty - TONY
snipeobjectheader.SkipToEnd
TOnys SetCurrentManipulator function and changes

TONY
   Tangent handles need to store with magnitude, alpha and gamma
	Bias Handles
	Need to be created when you turn on/off Show for Focus Object   
	No Undo?
	Peak is weird
	Select Vertex 260 edge 362 on fish

Joe Williamsen selections features
Hit W a second time to show manipulator
Look into Double click on folders adds new objects
n Real-time mode of SplitPoly for speed
Turn around selection bounds if no FocusWeld
    Rename to Collapse
    Add Percentages
    Add Edgemode commandui
Auto add bone assignments for new geometry, splitface too
Default manipulator
Need fast way to move Vertes on an edge without changing UV's.  Will make cool manipulators and speed up AddVertex and SPlitPoly
Save all preferences
123 key constraints
Hidden percentage
Syntax command parameters
Convert importer to commands and have right click on folders, along with DoubleCLick
need Segment Tool
AlignConnectedNormalsLike
Allow properties to have no Undo
Select Manipulator has Space bar for choose selection type
1, 2, 3 keys adds that many segents to all selected edges
Bevel for verts, edges, and faces
extrude
Selections features
Manipulator and navigator commansUIs
OnModified
Spline Component selection, edge of direction of vertex selection and drawing
   Write FindNearest functions for Edge, Poly
   Draw Neareast components different.
Customize Buttons
Finish Navigator plugins
   Add AnimateCamera stuff
