------------
X	Translate and Scale need two dimensional axis constrainers. (possibly Maya-like)
X	Rotate needs angle feedback.
	Rotate gets deadlocked when the disc you are rotating is straight at you.
X	Ortho views don't work.
	Ability to offset the pivot for scale and rotate.
	Undoability for scale.
	World/Local axis property.
X	Manipulator property tab.
	Ability to manipulate current hitbox without being on it. (Maybe Alt-drag)
