I use this file to keep track of planned changes or ideas that pop into my head.

Multipel Selection
==================

	The user should be able to select multiple objects at the same time.  A shift or control key should be used.
	When the user selects multiple objects, he can choose to group them, which will insert an invisible sprite
	as the parent.
	
	Size and position should effect all sprites when they are selected or when part of a group.

Rules for Object Naming
=======================

	Because the name of a sprite is exported to a C header file, the name of the file must have certain rules.
	i.e. it cannot start with a number or contain spaces, and special characters such as () or {} are not
	allowed.
	
Drag and Drop Textures
======================

	You should be able to drag a texture from the thumbnail/texture browser and drop it into the game window.
	There are some issues with this.  The size of the texture in the preview window will be different than
	what is inserted into the game window.
	
Tools to Align Objects
======================

	There needs to be some tools to align objects.  Rulers would be nice, and a button to align sprites to
	a certain position or space them evenly or make them all the same size, for example.
